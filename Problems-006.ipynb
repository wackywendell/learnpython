This distance is approximately the euclidean distance between the two points, neglecting the curvature of the earth. you can compute the euclidean distance between two long/lat pairs by using the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def euclidean_dist(long0,long1,lat0,lat1 ,unit = 'miles'):\n",
    "    '''approximate the euclidean (direct) distance between two lat/long pairs in miles or km'''\n",
